Assembly and installation guide for the RoboDash enclosure.

toc::[]

== Overview

The RoboDash enclosure is 3D printed in PETG-CF (Carbon Fiber filled PETG) for strength and heat resistance. The design accommodates the Corsair Xeneon Edge display, Raspberry Pi 4, and MCP2515 CAN module.

== Materials Required

=== 3D Printing

|===
| Material | Notes

| PETG-CF | Production parts - strength, heat resistance
| PLA | Prototyping only - not suitable for vehicle use
| Layer Height | 0.2mm recommended
| Infill | 40-60%
| Supports | Required for some parts
|===

CAUTION: PLA will deform in a hot vehicle interior. Use PETG-CF or ABS for production.

| File | Description | Print Notes

| `Robodash Left Top.stl` | Left upper enclosure | Supports needed
| `Robodash Left Bottom.stl` | Left lower enclosure | No supports
| `Robodash Right Top.stl` | Right upper enclosure | Supports needed
| `Robodash Right Bottom.stl` | Right lower enclosure | No supports
|===

The enclosure is split into 4 parts to fit on standard 3D printer beds.

== Printing Instructions

1. **Orientation**: Print top pieces face-down for best surface finish
2. **Supports**: Use tree supports for overhangs
3. **First Layer**: Ensure good bed adhesion - use brim if needed
4. **Temperature**: PETG-CF typically 240-260°C nozzle, 70-80°C bed

=== Recommended Settings (PETG-CF)

| Setting | Value

| Nozzle Temp | 250°C
| Bed Temp | 75°C
| Layer Height | 0.2mm
| Infill | 50%
| Perimeters | 3
| Top/Bottom Layers | 4
| Print Speed | 50mm/s

== Assembly

=== Step 1: Install Heat-Set Inserts

Insert M3 heat-set inserts into the mounting holes using a soldering iron:

1. Heat iron to 200°C
2. Place insert on hole
3. Press straight down with iron
4. Allow to cool before handling

=== Step 2: Mount Raspberry Pi

1. Apply foam tape to Pi mounting area
2. Place Raspberry Pi on standoffs
3. Secure with M3x6mm screws
4. Connect ribbon cables if using DSI display

=== Step 3: Install MCP2515 Module

1. Mount MCP2515 near Pi GPIO header
2. Connect SPI wires (see HARDWARE.adoc)
3. Route CAN wires to external connector

=== Step 4: Install Display

1. Test fit display in enclosure
2. Apply foam tape around display perimeter
3. Carefully seat display
4. Secure with M3x8mm screws

=== Step 5: Join Enclosure Halves

1. Route all cables
2. Align top and bottom sections
3. Secure with screws

=== Step 6: Final Wiring

1. Connect display USB-C
2. Connect CAN wires to vehicle harness
3. Connect power (USB-C from DC-DC converter)

== Vehicle Installation

=== Mounting Location

The dashboard mounts in the standard gauge cluster location:

- Must not obstruct driver view
- Must be within easy glance angle
- Must not interfere with airbags or controls

=== Wiring Routing

1. Route CAN wires to ECU location
2. Route power from switched 12V source
3. Use grommets where wires pass through panels
4. Secure all wiring with cable ties

=== CAN Bus Connection

1. Locate EMU Black CAN output
2. Connect CAN_H and CAN_L
3. Verify termination (see HARDWARE.adoc)
4. Test with `candump can0`

== Safety Considerations

[IMPORTANT]
====
- The dashboard is a **passive display only** - no driver interaction while vehicle is in motion
- All mounting must be secure to prevent dislodging in an accident
- Wiring must not interfere with vehicle controls
- Power must be from switched source to prevent battery drain
- Follow all FIA/regulatory requirements for dashboard visibility
====

== Testing

Before vehicle installation:

1. Bench test with mock data: `python -m src.main --mock`
2. Test CAN communication with ECU powered
3. Verify all gauges display correctly
4. Check warning indicators work

== Troubleshooting

See link:TROUBLESHOOTING.adoc[TROUBLESHOOTING.adoc] for common issues.
